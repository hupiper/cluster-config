I cloned this from Gerald Nunn's repository - I suggest you check it out. Great stuff! https://github.com/hupiper/cluster-config

# GitOps Cluster Configuration

This repo contains the cluster configuration I use for my personal OpenShift clusters. Like my other GitOps repos it leverages ArgoCD heavily. This repo originally followed the folder structure defined in the [Standards](https://github.com/gnunn-gitops/standards) repository but there has been some tweaks that need to be reflected back in that document.

# Structure

Similar to standards document, the repo consists of three high level folders:

- _bootstrap_ - the minimal yaml needed to bootstrap the cluster-config into argocd. It deploys a known sealed-secret private key along with an "app of app" `cluster-config-manager` that deploys the entirety of the cluster configuration.
- _components_ - a base set of kustomize manifests and yaml for applications, operators, configuration and ArgoCD app/project definitions. Everything is inherited from here
- _clusters_ - Cluster specific configuration, this inherits and kustomizes from the components folder and uses an identical structure.

# Usage

Cluster specific configuration is stored in the bootstrap/overlays folder. To deploy the cluster configuration, simply do a `oc apply -k bootstrap/overlays/{clustername}`. Under the hood this kustomize does the following:

- Creates a sealedsecrets project and deploys a known private key into the namespace. This is done so I can re-use an existing key since my clusters are ephemeral and constantly being deployed. Creating new keys would mean re-encrypting all my secrets which is out of scope for demos.
- Creates an ArgoCD AppProject called `cluster-config`
- Deploys a single application, cluster-config-manager, using the app-of-app pattern to deploy everything else.

# Sequence

This repo uses Argo CD sync waves to configure the configuration in an ordered manner. The following waves are used:

1. Sealed Secrets
2. Lets Encrypt for wildcard routes
3. Storage (iscsi storageclass and PVs)
4. Cluster Configuration (Authentication, AlertManager, etc)
5. Operators (Pipelines, CSO, Compliance, Namespace Operator, etc)

# ArgoCD App Generation

In my original version of this repo I was storing individual ArgoCD applications in the components (then manifests) directory and then patching these as needed to support cluster specific variations. This proved to be a lot of a yaml to maintain so with ApplicationSets being available in the gitops-operator I was excited about simplfying things.

Unfortunately ApplicationSets does not currently support sync waves which I am relying on here to deploy things like sealed-secrets and certificates before everything else. However at it's core ApplicationSets is simply a templating pattern and I opted to just replicate this on the client side. In each cluster overlay you will see a set of Argo CD applications, i.e. `clusters/home/argocd/apps/base`. These are generated using a bash script called `generate-argocd-apps.sh` with the goal to reduce the overhead of managing ArgoCD applications.

Once ApplicationSets support sync waves I plan on revisiting this.
